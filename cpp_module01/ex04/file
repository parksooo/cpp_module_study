(A) Susan was waiting for her train on the platform with her friend, Michael.
He wanted her to take a half of a sandwich (a) he had left over from dinner. 
She told him she didn't want it, but he kept insisting through the course of their conversation. 
Susan and Michael lived in different directions and her train came in first,
so she said goodnight to him and got on the train and sat down.

(B) When the nearly empty train was one stop before her station, a homeless man came through the door of the adjoining car.
He was very dirty and *mumbling to himself. 
As he neared her, she could see his eyes were very wild-looking. 
(b) He came towards her and without a word grabbed her by the right jacket sleeve. 
She was terrified. His face started to get closer to hers, when all of a sudden she remembered the sandwich in her bag.

(C) Quickly she asked him, "Are you hungry?" He nodded furiously.
She pulled out the half sandwich (c) her friend had tossed to her and gave it to him.
Then he let go of her and proceeded to the next car.
Ten seconds later she pulled into her stop and she ran off the train as fast as she could.
The doors closed and the train took off.

(D) Just before the doors closed, (d) he called her name.
Susan looked up, and before she knew it he threw the sandwich at her.
It landed in her lap. At the same moment the doors closed and the train began to move.
She saw him smiling on the platform. She made a face at (e) him and put the sandwich in her bag.
